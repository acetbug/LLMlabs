Iâ€™ve been watching them all day. You couldnâ€™t find two people who are less like us. And theyâ€™ve got this son â€” I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.\"*  \\n\\nShe worries that the Dursleys will not understand or appreciate Harryâ€™s magical nature and may mistreat him. She also fears that growing up in such a stifling, unloving environment could be harmful to Harry, especially given his fame and importance in the wizarding world.  \\n\\nDumbledore, however, insists that Harry must stay with his relatives because of the blood protection provided by his motherâ€™s sacrifice, which will keep him safe from Voldemort as long as he calls Privet Drive home. McGonagall reluctantly accepts this but remains skeptical about the Dursleys\\' ability to raise Harry well.'}"
