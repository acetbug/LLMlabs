       "The creation of black holes is a complex astrophysical process that involves the collapse of massive stars. According to our current understanding of general relativity, a black hole is formed when a star with a mass at least three times that of the sun exhausts its fuel and undergoes a supernova explosion. If the star is sufficiently massive, its gravity will be so strong that it will overcome the degeneracy pressure of the star's core, causing it to collapse into a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume.\n",
       "\n",
       "This collapse creates a boundary called the event horizon, which marks the point of no return around a black hole. Any matter or radiation that crosses the event horizon is trapped by the black hole's gravity and cannot escape. The event horizon is not a physical boundary but rather a mathematical concept that marks the point at which the escape velocity from the black hole exceeds the speed of light.\n",
       "\n",
       "The process of black hole formation can be divided into several stages, including the main sequence, red giant, and white dwarf phases, followed by the supernova explosion and collapse. The resulting black hole can have a mass ranging from a few solar masses to millions or even billions of solar masses, depending on the mass of the progenitor star.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are four types of black holes, each with different properties and formation mechanisms: stellar black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, supermassive black holes, and miniature black holes. Stellar black holes are formed from the collapse of individual stars, while supermassive black holes are found at the centers of galaxies and are thought to have formed through the merger of smaller black holes.\n",
